Mind Melt Matching is my take on the classic children memory game. I'm not big into video games, so I wanted to stick with a game that I actually know.

I used bright colors and strong, repetative patterns to induce headaches and ultimately make an easy game slightly more difficult and induce anxiety.

The game starts at the home page that was created in the index.html and links to 3 different levels. Each level has an additional pair to match and its own wild patern. The paterns are intended to be more difficult to look at as the levels progress.

In the begininning I was trying to create the odjects using javascript, but I was struggling to wrap my mind around how to make it function and display. I took a step back and decided to create the objects using HTML and CSS and then add function to them using javascript.

I had some difficulties in making a shuffle button that works, so to shuffle the cards you have to refresh the page. I also had trouble getting the game to display  "You win!" when all cards are matched. I think its  because of how I set up the html files.

My main resource to get set in the right direction was this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek

I also used some documentation and reviewed past classes. I wamted to keep all code to things we have learned in order to practice and make sure I understand the basics before I move on
